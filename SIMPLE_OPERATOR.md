# Build a simple Golang-based operator Part 1

In this tutorial, we will provide all of the information needed to get quickly up and running building and deploying
your first operator to OpenShift. **Note** that this same general idea can be applied to MiniKube, or other Kubernetes 
clusters, but the commands may be just a bit different.

## Expectations
* You are learning and want to develop a Golang based operator to manage Kubernetes resources
* You do not have much experience developing operators
* You have some very very basic, or no knowledge about Kubernetes Operators
* You want to hands-on experience developing and deploying your first operator to OpenShift

This tutorial does NOT cover all the Kubernetes concepts needed to understand operators. Instead, it offers
the commands and basic knowledge needed to deploy your first operator. To learn more about the concepts 
needed to understand how to build your first Golang based operator, read my notes [here](https://github.ibm.com/TT-ISV-org/operator/blob/main/notes/what-i-learned-notes.md). Also, make sure to read this [blog post](https://www.openshift.com/blog/introducing-the-operator-framework) by 
Red Hat introducing the high-level idea of operators.

If you already know all of the basic concepts of operators and have developed and deployed on before, this tutorial 
is not for you. Move on to the intermediate-level tutorial, [here](https://github.ibm.com/TT-ISV-org/operator/blob/main/README.md), which will explain the low-level functions within the Operator reconcile 
function in more detail.

Now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, we need to make sure your machine is ready for 
operator development. Read the installation requirements and prerequisites [here](https://github.ibm.com/TT-ISV-org/operator/blob/main/installation.md).

## Steps
1. [Create a new project using Operator SDK](#1-create-a-new-project-using-operator-sdk)
1. [Create CRD and Custom Controller](#2-Create-CRD-and-Custom-Controller)
1. [Update CRD and generate CRD manifest](#3-Update-CRD-and-generate-CRD-manifest)
1. [Implement Controller Logic](#4-implement-controller-logic)
1. [Compile, build and push](#5-compile-build-and-push)
1. [Deploy the operator](#6-deploy-the-operator)
1. [Test and verify](#7-test-and-verify)


## 1. Create a new project using Operator SDK

ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ Note: this steps are taken from the [Operator-SDK tutorial](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/tutorial/). All credit goes to them.ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

First check your Go version. This tutorial is tested with the following Go version:

```bash
$ go version
$ go version go1.15.6 darwin/amd64
```
Next, create a directory for where you will hold your project files. 

```bash
$ mkdir $HOME/projects/memcached-operator
$ cd $HOME/projects/memcached-operator
```
<!-- 
Since we are not in our $GOPATH, we can activate module support by running the 
`export GO111MODULE=on` command before using the operator-sdk. -->

Next, run the `operator-sdk init` command to create a new memcached-operator project:

```bash
$ operator-sdk init --domain=example.com --repo=github.com/example/memcached-operator --owner="Memcache Operator authors"
```

This will create the basic scaffold for your operator, such as the `bin`, `config` and `hack` directories, and will create the `main.go` file which initializes the manager.

## 2. Create CRD and Custom Controller

Next, we will use the `operator-sdk create api` command to create a blank <b>custom resource definition,
or CRD</b> which will be in your `api` directory and a blank custom controller file, which will be in your 
`controllers` directory.

We will use the --group, --version, and --kind flags to pass in the resource 
group and version. The <b>--group, --version, and --kind</b> flags together form the fully qualified name of a Kubernetes resource type. This name must be unique across a cluster.

```bash
$ operator-sdk create api --group=cache --version=v1alpha1 --kind=Memcached --controller --resource
Writing scaffold for you to edit...
api/v1alpha1/memcached_types.go
controllers/memcached_controller.go
```

Now, once you deploy this operator, you can use the `kubectl api-resources` to see the name
`cache.example.com` as the api-group, and `Memcached` as the `Kind`. We can try this command 
later after we've deployed the operator.

## 3. Update CRD and generate CRD manifest

One of the two main parts of the operator pattern is defining a Custom Resource Definition(CRD). We
will do that in the `api/v1alpha1/memcached_types.go` file.

First, add a `Size int32` field to your `MemcachedSpec` struct, as shown below:

```go
// MemcachedSpec defines the desired state of Memcached
type MemcachedSpec struct {
	// INSERT ADDITIONAL SPEC FIELDS - desired state of cluster
	// Important: Run "make" to regenerate code after modifying this file

	// Foo is an example field of Memcached. Edit Memcached_types.go to remove/update
	Size int32 `json:"size"`
}
```

When we create a custom resource later, we will  need to fill out the size, which is the number of `Memcached` replicas we want as the `desired state` of my system. 


Next, add a `Nodes []string` field to your `MemcachedStatus` struct, as shown below:

```go
// MemcachedStatus defines the observed state of Memcached
type MemcachedStatus struct {
	// INSERT ADDITIONAL STATUS FIELD - define observed state of cluster
	// Important: Run "make" to regenerate code after modifying this file
	Nodes []string `json:"nodes"`
}
```

The `MemcachedStatus` struct will use a string array to list the name of the Memcached pods in the current state.
At a high-level the `Memcached` struct will have the fields `Spec` and `Status` to denote the desired state (spec) and the observed state (status) of the cluster. When the system recognizes there is a difference in the spec and the status, the operator will use custom controller logic defined in our 
`controllers/memcached_controller.go` file to update the 
system to be in the desired state.

After making the changes from above, your memcached_types.go file show look like the following:

```go
package v1alpha1

import (
	metav1 "k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1"
)

// EDIT THIS FILE!  THIS IS SCAFFOLDING FOR YOU TO OWN!
// NOTE: json tags are required.  Any new fields you add must have json tags for the fields to be serialized.

// MemcachedSpec defines the desired state of Memcached
type MemcachedSpec struct {
	// INSERT ADDITIONAL SPEC FIELDS - desired state of cluster
	// Important: Run "make" to regenerate code after modifying this file

	// Foo is an example field of Memcached. Edit Memcached_types.go to remove/update
	Size int32 `json:"size"`
}

// MemcachedStatus defines the observed state of Memcached
type MemcachedStatus struct {
	// INSERT ADDITIONAL STATUS FIELD - define observed state of cluster
	// Important: Run "make" to regenerate code after modifying this file
	Nodes []string `json:"nodes"`
}

// +kubebuilder:object:root=true
// +kubebuilder:subresource:status

// Memcached is the Schema for the memcacheds API
type Memcached struct {
	metav1.TypeMeta   `json:",inline"`
	metav1.ObjectMeta `json:"metadata,omitempty"`

	Spec   MemcachedSpec   `json:"spec,omitempty"`
	Status MemcachedStatus `json:"status,omitempty"`
}

// +kubebuilder:object:root=true

// MemcachedList contains a list of Memcached
type MemcachedList struct {
	metav1.TypeMeta `json:",inline"`
	metav1.ListMeta `json:"metadata,omitempty"`
	Items           []Memcached `json:"items"`
}

func init() {
	SchemeBuilder.Register(&Memcached{}, &MemcachedList{})
}
```

## 4. Implement controller logic

Now that we have our CRDs registered, our next step is to implement our controller logic in `controllers/memcached_controller.go`. First, go ahead and copy the code from the 
[artifacts/memcached_controller.go](https://github.ibm.com/TT-ISV-org/operator/blob/main/artifacts/memcached_controller.go) file, and replace your current controller code. The next
few paragraphs will explain the controller code in detail. 

The controller "Reconcile" method contains the logic responsible for monitoring and applying the requested state for specific deployments. It does so by sending client requests to Kubernetes APIs, and will run every time a Custom Resource is modified by a user or changes state (ex. pod fails). If the reconcile method fails, it can be re-queued to run again.

After scaffolding our controller via the operator-sdk, we'll have an empty Reconciler function.

In this example, we want our Reconciler to
1. Check for an existing memcached deployment, and create one if it does not exist.
2. Retrieve the current state of our memcached deployment, and compare it to our desired state. More specifically, we'll compare the memcached deployment ReplicaSet value to the "Size" parameter that we defined earlier in our `memcached_types.go` file.
3. If the number of pods in the deployment ReplicaSet does not match the provided `Size`, then our Reconciler will update the ReplicaSet value, and re-queue the Reconciler until the desired state is achieved.

ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ Note: we will not dive deep into the logic right now. Just know that this operator will create a deployment for a memcached resource if one does not exist already. If you want to learn more about the deep dive into the 
controller logic, go to the intermediate tutorial [here](https://github.ibm.com/TT-ISV-org/operator/blob/main/README.md)ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§


Once you've pasted the [example controller code](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/v1.3.0/testdata/go/v3/memcached-operator/controllers/memcached_controller.go) into your `memcached_controller.go` file is complete, your controller should look the following:

### Build manifests and go files

Before we compile our code, we need to change a couple of things in order to make sure we can deploy onto
OpenShift. If you are not deploying onto OpenShift, you may not need to change the Dockerfile or `manager.yaml` 
in your `config/manager` directory 

1. Make sure to change 
your Dockerfile so it looks exactly as the [one in the Artifacts directory](https://github.ibm.com/TT-ISV-org/operator/blob/main/artifacts/Dockerfile). It should look like this:

```Dockerfile
# Build the manager binary
FROM golang:1.15 as builder

WORKDIR /workspace
# Copy the Go Modules manifests
COPY go.mod go.mod
COPY go.sum go.sum
# cache deps before building and copying source so that we don't need to re-download as much
# and so that source changes don't invalidate our downloaded layer
RUN go mod download

# Copy the go source
COPY main.go main.go
COPY api/ api/
COPY controllers/ controllers/

# Build
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 GO111MODULE=on go build -a -o manager main.go

# Use distroless as minimal base image to package the manager binary
# Refer to https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless for more details
FROM gcr.io/distroless/static:nonroot
WORKDIR /
COPY --from=builder /workspace/manager .

ENTRYPOINT ["/manager"]
```

2. Make sure to change 
your `manager.yaml` file in your `config/manager` directory so it looks exactly as the [one in the Artifacts directory](https://github.ibm.com/TT-ISV-org/operator/blob/main/artifacts/manager.yaml). It 
should look like the following: 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  labels:
    control-plane: controller-manager
  name: system
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: controller-manager
  namespace: system
  labels:
    control-plane: controller-manager
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      control-plane: controller-manager
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        control-plane: controller-manager
    spec:
      securityContext:
      containers:
      - command:
        - /manager
        args:
        - --leader-elect
        image: controller:latest
        name: manager
        securityContext:
          allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /healthz
            port: 8081
          initialDelaySeconds: 15
          periodSeconds: 20
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /readyz
            port: 8081
          initialDelaySeconds: 5
          periodSeconds: 10
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 30Mi
          requests:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 20Mi
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 10
```

ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ Note: this step and explanations are taken from the [Operator-SDK tutorial](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/tutorial/). All credit goes to them.ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

Now that we have our controller code and memcached types implemented, run the following command to update the generated code for that resource type:

```bash
$ make generate
```

The above command will use the controller-gen utility in `bin/controller-gen` to update the api/v1alpha1/zz_generated.deepcopy.go file to ensure our APIâ€™s Go type definitions implement the `runtime.Object` interface that all Kind types must implement.

Once the API is defined with spec/status fields and CRD validation markers, the CRD manifests can be generated and updated with the following command:

```bash
$ make manifests
```

This command will invoke controller-gen to generate the CRD manifests at `config/crd/bases/cache.example.com_memcacheds.yaml` - you can see the yaml representation 
of the object we specified in our `_types.go` file. 

## 5. Compile, build and push

At this point, we are ready to compile, build the image of our operator, and push the image to an 
image repository. You can use the image registry of your choice, but here we will use Docker Hub. If we 
plan on deploying to an OpenShift cluster, we need to login to our cluster now.

### Prepare your OpenShift Cluster

(If you haven't already) provision an OpenShift cluster by going to `https://cloud.ibm.com/` and clicking `Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud` and get into 

![OpenShift](images/openshift-1.png)

Once you provisioned the cluster, select the cluster and go to `OpenShift web console` by clicking the button from top right corner of the page.

![OpenShift](images/openshift-2.png)

From the OpenShift web console, copy the login command from the account drop down menu.

![OpenShift](images/openshift-3.png)

and from your terminal run the command to login to your cluster.

If you haven't created a project, create a project by going to projects and clicking `Create Project`. From the terminal after you logged in change the project by running following in your terminal.

Note: you can also use the `oc new-project <new-project-name>` command to create a new project.
The below command simply switches you to an existing project.

```bash
oc project <project name>

```

### Create Operator Image

The generated code from the `operator-sdk` creates a `Makefile` which allows you to use `make` command to compile your `go` operator code. The same make command also allows you to build and push the docker image.

To compile the code run the following command in the terminal from your project root:
```bash
make install
```

**Note:** You will need to have an account to a image repository like Docker Hub to be able to push your 
operator image. Use `Docker login` to login.

To build the Docker image run the following command. Note that you can also 
use the regular `docker build -t` command to build as well. 

`<username>` is your Docker Hub (or Quay.io) username, and `<version>` is the 
version of the operator image you will deploy. Note that each time you 
make a change to your operator code, it is good practice to increment the 
version.


```bash
make docker-build IMG=docker.io/<username>/memcached-operator:<version>
```
and push the docker image to your registry using following from your terminal:

 ```bash
make docker-push IMG=docker.io/<username>/memcached-operator:<version>

 ```

## 6. Deploy the operator

#### Deploy the operator to OpenShift cluster

Make sure that the controller manager manifest has the right namespace and docker image. Apply the same to the default manifest as well by running following command:

```bash
export IMG=docker.io/<username>/memcached-operator:<version>
export NAMESPACE=<oc-project-name>

cd config/manager
kustomize edit set image controller=${IMG}
kustomize edit set namespace "${NAMESPACE}"
cd ../../

cd config/default
kustomize edit set namespace "${NAMESPACE}"
cd ../../
```


To Deploy the operator run the following command from your terminal:

```bash
make deploy IMG=docker.io/<username>/memcached-operator:<version>
```

The output of the deployment should look like the following:
```bash
...go-workspace/src/memcached-operator/bin/controller-gen "crd:trivialVersions=true,preserveUnknownFields=false" rbac:roleName=manager-role webhook paths="./..." output:crd:artifacts:config=config/crd/bases
cd config/manager && ...go-workspace/src/memcached-operator/bin/kustomize edit set image controller=sanjeevghimire/memcached-operator:v0.0.5
.../go-workspace/src/memcached-operator/bin/kustomize build config/default | kubectl apply -f -
Warning: kubectl apply should be used on resource created by either kubectl create --save-config or kubectl apply
namespace/sanjeev-operator-prj configured
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/memcacheds.cache.example.com configured
role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/memcached-operator-leader-election-role created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/memcached-operator-manager-role configured
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/memcached-operator-metrics-reader unchanged
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/memcached-operator-proxy-role unchanged
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/memcached-operator-leader-election-rolebinding created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/memcached-operator-manager-rolebinding configured
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/memcached-operator-proxy-rolebinding configured
configmap/memcached-operator-manager-config created
service/memcached-operator-controller-manager-metrics-service created
deployment.apps/memcached-operator-controller-manager created
```

To make sure everything is working correctly, use the `oc get pods` command.

```bash
oc get pods

NAME                                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
memcached-operator-controller-manager-54c5864f7b-znwws   2/2     Running   0          14s
```

This means your operator is up and running. Next, let's create some custom resources via our operator.

Next, update your custom resource, by modifying the `config/samples/cache_v1alpha1_memcached.yaml` file
to look like the following:

```yaml
apiVersion: cache.example.com/v1alpha1
kind: Memcached
metadata:
  name: memcached-sample
spec:
  # Add fields here
  size: 3
``` 
Note that all we did is set the size of the Memcached replicas to be 3.

And finally create the custom resources using the following command:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f config/samples/cache_v1alpha1_memcached.yaml
```

#### Verify that resources are Running

From the terminal run `kubectl get all` or `oc get all` to make sure that controllers, managers and pods have been successfully created and is in `Running` state with the right number of pods as defined in the spec.

```bash
kubectl get all 
```

Output:
![kubectl get all](images/kubectl-get-all.png)

Also from your cluster you can see the logs by going to your project in `OpenShift web console`

![kubectl get all](images/os-logs.png)

You can also now run `oc api-resources` to view the memcache resource we have created:
```bash
oc api-resources
NAME                APIGROUP                  NAMESPACED   KIND
memcacheds         cache.example.com          true         Memcached
```

Lastly, if you want to make some code changes in the controller and build and deploy a new version of your operator, you can simply use the `build-and-deploy.sh` script. Just make sure
to set your namespace and img in that file.

Run the script by issuing the following command:

```bash
$ ./build-and-deploy.sh
```

## 7. Test and verify

Update `config/samples/<group>_<version>_memcached.yaml` to change the `spec.size` field in the Memcached CR. This will increase the application pods from 3 to 5.

```bash
oc patch memcached memcached-sample -p '{"spec":{"size": 5}}' --type=merge
```

You can also update the spec.size from `OpenShift web console` by going to `Deployments` and selecting `memcached-sample` and increase/decrease using the up or down arrow:

![kubectl get all](images/inc-dec-size.png)

**Congratulations!** You've successfully deployed an operator using the `operator-sdk`!


## Cleanup

The `Makefile` part of generated project has a target called `undeploy` which deletes all the resource. You can run following to cleanup all the resources:

```bash
make undeploy
```
